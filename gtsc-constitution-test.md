Article VII– Officer Elections
Section 1 - Introduction & Eligibility
The elections for the forthcoming year will be conducted in the Spring semester, not later than two weeks before final examinations. New Executive Board members will serve alongside outgoing Executive Board members for the end of the Spring semester.
Specific eligibility requirements exist for the Presidential candidates and Meet Director candidates: 
In the event where there are less than two Presidential candidates from the pool of nominees that have qualifying prior Executive Board experience, members who have served SC as a Chair for at least two semesters shall be allowed presidential candidacy in a renomination period. Appropriate time shall be given in the election process to solicit these new nominations. 
In the event where there are still less than two Presidential candidates meeting the above criterion, nominees that have been active members of SC for at least three semesters at the time of nomination shall be allowed presidential candidacy in a renomination period.   
In the event that a presidential candidate is deemed unfit to serve as president by a unanimous decision of the remaining Board members, the remaining members can veto their nomination. 
In the event of an emergency situation in which there are no Meet Director candidates who have prior Executive Board, Chair, or meet committee experience, election of the position will be dictated by the current officer board. 

Section 2 - Election Structure
Elections shall be held in four distinct stages, the exact duration of which will be determined by the current Executive Board. The stages shall be the following:
Call for nominations and nominees: In this phase, the timeline of the election will be announced to members and the process of collecting nominations will begin. Nomination collection shall be open for at least three (3) days.
Collecting platforms: Members who have been nominated or self-nominated will be notified by the sitting President once it has been determined by the Executive Board that they meet the requirements for the position. Nominees will be given a deadline to submit their written platforms. Platform collection shall be open for at least five (5) days.
Release of platforms: All candidate platforms will be compiled and released to the membership for consideration. Platforms shall be available for at least three (3) days before voting.
Voting: Voting shall be open for at least five (5) days.
Meet Director elections follow a separate timeline due to the necessity of an upcoming Meet Director for a Nationals/Regionals bid. It will conclude before the end of the fall semester and before the submission of a Nationals Bid, if one is submitted. The election will otherwise follow the structure defined above. This Meet Director will hold the position in the following season, however they will work with the current Meet Director to create the Nationals/Regionals bid and learn the correct software for running a meet and submitting meet entries.
If there are no candidates for the fall Meet Director election, the election will take place in conjunction with the rest of Officer elections in the following Spring semester.
Any student member may campaign or be nominated for any position on the Executive Board other than restrictions defined elsewhere in this document. In the event that multiple SC members would like to run as joint Executive Board members for any position except for President, they are able to do so; no position may hold more than 2 joint Officers per term, each with their own vote. Candidates  that plan on studying abroad, co-oping, or interning during their term of service are permitted to run for office  if and only if they can keep up with their duties remotely or they are in a joint position with another member that will not be simultaneously studying abroad, co-oping, or interning during their term of service. 
The candidate for each office receiving a majority vote of members will be considered the victor. If no candidate receives a majority vote, then there will be a run-off between the two candidates with the most votes. The candidate who receives the most votes will be the victor. If there is a run-off tie, the highest ranking outgoing officer not involved in the run-off will make the final decision. No member can be elected to more than one position on the Executive Board at a time. 
New officers take office at the last meeting of the Spring semester and remain in office until their successors assume their positions. 
If a position remains unfilled after the election process the President will appoint a member to the position or re-assign duties to other officers.

Article VIII- Officer Removal
If an officer fails to maintain Institute requirements as stated in the GT Catalog, they shall resign immediately. 
If it is believed that an officer is not fulfilling their constitutional duties, then a petition requesting their removal must be signed by at least half of the voting membership or Executive Board and presented at a general meeting. Then, upon verification of the validity of the petition, by the Advisor, and, at least two weeks but no more than four weeks from the date of submission, another meeting shall be held at which the grievance will be presented, with both sides having the opportunity to present a case. 
The Advisor, if appropriate, shall preside over the removal hearing.  After all arguments have been heard, a secret-ballot vote shall be held. Assuming a quorum of 50 percent of the club membership, if at least two-thirds of the ballots cast vote for removal, the officer shall be removed immediately. 
If the President is removed or resigns, the Vice-President will take their place in the interim until the next election cycle. All other officers will be nominated by the membership and voted on in accordance with Article VII at the next meeting. In this case, the victor will take office immediately following the election and will fulfill the term of the officer that they are replacing.
